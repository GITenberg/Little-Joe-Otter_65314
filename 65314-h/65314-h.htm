<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Little Joe Otter.</span></p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Of</span> all the little Quaddies who
live in the Green Meadows, the
Smiling Pool and the Green Forest,
none is more surprising than Little
Joe Otter. He is full of surprises,
is Little Joe. He has a way
of suddenly bobbing up and just
as suddenly disappearing, which
makes him one of the hardest of all
the little people to get acquainted
with. Just when you think there
is no one around, up bobs Little
Joe and gives you a surprise.
Just when you are watching him,
down he goes and you never see
him again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when you are acquainted
with him, he is just as surprising.
He is full of pranks and dearly
loves to play. He is a wonderful
swimmer, as no one knows better
than those who live in the
Smiling Pool. At times he is a
great traveler in spite of his short
legs, and he knows more of the
Great World than most of his
neighbors. In winter he swims
under the ice and makes slippery
slides down the snowy banks. In
summer he makes slippery slides
on muddy banks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is his wonderful swimming
power which enables him to do
many things in secret. You see,
when he disappears under the
water, his neighbors on land have
no way of knowing where he goes
or what he does. Billy Mink and
Jerry Muskrat are the only ones
who know much about Little Joe
Otter, and even they do not know
as much as they might, or as they
think they do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Peter Rabbit had missed Little
Joe Otter in the Smiling Pool
this spring. He had asked Jerry
Muskrat and Billy Mink where
Little Joe was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” replied Jerry Muskrat.
“Probably he is on one of his
foolish long journeys. What any
one wants to leave the Smiling
Pool for is more than I can
understand. Probably if you go
down to the Big River, you will
find him fishing there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just then there was a sudden
splash right behind Jerry Muskrat.
It was so sudden that it startled
Jerry, and the first thing that
Jerry does when he is startled is
to dive. He did this time. When
he came up, Peter Rabbit was
still sitting on the bank of the
Smiling Pool.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What was it that frightened
me?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Peter grinned. “I’m sure I
don’t know. All I saw was a
splash in the water.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Chuga-rum!” cried Grandfather
Frog in his deepest, gruffest voice.
“If I know anything about it, it
was Little Joe Otter himself. I
think, Jerry Muskrat, if you go
far enough up the Laughing Brook,
you will find that Little Joe is
up there and not down at the
Big River. I saw something that
looked to me very much like a
dark form swimming under water
in that direction.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t believe it,” replied
Jerry. “Little Joe hasn’t been
in the Smiling Pool in ever and
ever so long. It would be a good
thing if Little Joe would settle
down. He ought to have a house
the same as I have. I never did
believe there was any good in this
roaming around.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just then there were two splashes
right where the Laughing Brook
comes into the Smiling Pool. Peter
and Grandfather Frog and Jerry
looked hastily in that direction.
Then they stared at each other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did I or didn’t I see double?”
Peter demanded. “It looked to me
much like two Little Joe Otters!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It looked to me very much
the same way,” said Jerry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grandfather Frog looked thoughtful.
“I have a suspicion,” said
he, “that little Joe Otter is springing
a surprise on us. Have any
of you heard of a Mrs. Joe?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Peter looked at Jerry and Jerry
looked at Peter. “Do you suppose
it can be true?” they both
exclaimed together.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>No</span> one had ever heard of a
Mrs. Joe Otter, yet if there wasn’t
a Mrs. Joe how was it that Grandfather
Frog and Peter Rabbit
and Jerry Muskrat, all three, had
seemed to see two little brown
heads where the Laughing Brook
comes into the Smiling Pool. For
a while they talked it over between
themselves. Each was sure
that he had seen two. It was
only for a moment and then there
was nothing to be seen. It was
all very mysterious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There must be something the
matter with our eyes,” declared
Jerry. “Little Joe is such an uneasy
fellow that he never would be
content to settle down with a home
of his own. Besides, wherever
would he have found Mrs. Joe, if
there is one?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know, but I’m going
to find out,” said Peter, hopping
up. “I’m going to go right
straight up the Laughing Brook
and look for his home. If he’s got
one, I don’t believe he can hide it
from me.” With this off started
Peter, lipperty-lipperty-lip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good luck to you, Peter. If
you find anything come back
and tell us,” shouted Jerry
Muskrat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Up the Laughing Brook went
Peter. Now he had no more idea
than the man in the moon what
kind of a home Little Joe Otter
would be likely to have. He
knew that Jerry Muskrat has two
kinds of homes—one a hole in a
bank, and the other a house in
the Smiling Pool. He knew that
Paddy the Beaver builds the same
kinds of homes, only better. He
knew that Billy Mink sometimes
makes his home in a hollow log
and sometimes under an old pile
of brush and sometimes in a hole
under a stump. Billy is not particular
as to where his home is.
But Peter didn’t know where to
look for Little Joe’s home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He lives in the water even
more than Billy Mink does, almost
as much as Jerry Muskrat does, so
I guess he probably has a home
right close to the water,” said
Peter. Then another thought
struck him. He remembered that
Jerry Muskrat makes his entrance
to his home in the bank under
water where it cannot be seen from
the shore. If Little Joe were to
do the same thing, he, Peter, might
just as well look for a needle in a
haystack. However, Peter is not
easily discouraged. He hopped
along, up one bank of the Laughing
Brook, looking and looking for
holes. Every hole he came to he
examined with the greatest care.
He sniffed and sniffed at each one,
hoping to get a whiff of Little
Joe Otter. When he had gone a
long way up the Laughing Brook
he crossed it on an old log and
went back down the other side,
looking and looking just the
same.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But with all Peter’s looking, he
didn’t find a thing. More than
this, he saw no signs that Little
Joe Otter had been up the Laughing
Brook for a long time. He
was just about to give up, discouraged,
when in a deep little
pool he heard a splash. He turned
quickly. He was just in time to
see Little Joe Otter swimming
away with a fish in his mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hi, Little Joe!” he called.
“Are you living up this way?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Little Joe grinned in spite of the
fish in his mouth. “Certainly I
am,” said Little Joe. “Come call
on me and meet Mrs. Joe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With that Little Joe suddenly
disappeared under water, and
though Peter sat for a long, long
time watching, he saw nothing more
of Little Joe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now however am I going to
make a call when I don’t know
where to call?” muttered Peter,
as he started for the dear Old
Briar-patch. “Anyway, I have
found out that there is a Mrs.
Joe!” he added triumphantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Now</span> though Peter Rabbit didn’t
know it, he had walked right
straight over the home of Little
Joe Otter. Many other little
forest people had walked over that
home without guessing it. You
see, Little Joe is just as smart in
making a home as he is in everything
else. Little Joe believes
that a home is just for those who
live there, and therefore that it is
a secret which no one else should
know. He had found Mrs. Joe
far away on the Big River and had
brought her back with him up the
Laughing Brook to the Smiling
Pool and through the Smiling Pool
farther up the Laughing Brook to
the place he had picked out for a
home. They had come right
through the Smiling Pool while
Grandfather Frog was sitting on his
green lily pad and Jerry Muskrat
was sitting on the Big Rock talking
to Peter Rabbit, who was sitting
on the bank. Only once had they
shown their little brown heads
above the water, and that was
when Peter and Jerry and Grandfather
Frog had thought they saw
double. You see, Mrs. Joe was
very, very shy, and so Little Joe
wanted her to become acquainted
with the Laughing Brook and her
new home before he introduced her
to his friends and neighbors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The place he had chosen for a
home was close beside one of the
deepest pools in the Laughing
Brook. Growing close to the
bank was a big tree with spreading
roots. The bank was steep
and mossy. All about grew the
Green Forest. It was very lovely
there. Also it was very quiet,
and you probably would have
called it very lonely. But it was
just such a place as Otters love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” cried Mrs. Joe, when she
saw it. “Is this where our home
is to be?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, my dear,” replied Little
Joe. “That is, it is if you like
it. I thought we could make our
house with a back door between
two of the roots of that old tree,
and with a front door deep down
under water. By and by, if we
want, we can have a slippery slide
down the bank. There are plenty
of fish in the Laughing Brook and
we are far enough in the Green
Forest not to have visitors very
often.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Joe dived into the little
pool. She was gone a long time
and Little Joe waited on the bank
anxiously. When she came up she
looked very happy. “It is perfectly
lovely!” she cried. “It is
the finest place for a home I ever
have seen. Let’s begin to make it
right away, Little Joe!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Little Joe didn’t wait for her to
change her mind. He remembered
how many times Polly Chuck had
changed her mind before Johnny
Chuck succeeded in getting her to
let him dig their home under the
old apple tree in the far corner of
the Old Orchard. “We’ll begin
right off,” said he. And that is
just what they did do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now you know Little Joe Otter
can stay under water a long time.
Mrs. Joe showed him just where
she wanted the front door, deep
down under water. Then they
took turns making a long, nice
hallway, slanting up from that
under-water doorway. When it
was high enough to be wholly
above water they made the nicest
little room, and then began a doorway
which would lead out between
two roots of the big tree.
At first they didn’t open this doorway,
because you see they had no
need of it. They just made the
hall and left the door closed, so
there wasn’t a thing to show where
their home was. When they
wanted to go out, they just slid
down their front hallway into the
little pool and then swam clear
across it before they came up.
This was so that if any sharp eyes
happened to see them, they never
would guess where they had come
from. When it was all done, they
had just the best time ever.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Do</span> you know that you can learn
things by sitting perfectly still?
You can. That is, you can if
you use your eyes and use your
ears and all the other senses that
Old Mother Nature has given you.
Peter Rabbit discovered it quite
by accident. You know how curious
he is. It seems as if his
curiosity never can be satisfied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the day that Little Joe
Otter invited him to call at his
home and then promptly disappeared,
Peter could think of nothing
but that home, and wonder
where it was. Whenever he got
the chance he went over to the
Green Forest to look for Little
Joe and his home. He had
hopped up and down the banks of
the Laughing Brook until his feet
ached, and he was just as wise
as before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last one day, he sat down
just a little way from a great big
tree with spreading roots near the
bank of a little pool in the Laughing
Brook. He was tired. Also
he was discouraged. “I don’t believe
Little Joe has a home at
all,” he muttered. Then, because
he was tired, he squatted down
in a little brown heap and closed
his eyes. How long he slept Peter
never knew. When he awoke it
was very, very still there in the
Green Forest. He felt rested and
therefore in a better frame of mind.
He decided he would sit there a
little longer and enjoy his beautiful
surrounding’s before going back
to the dear Old Briar-patch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now when Peter sits perfectly
still, he is very hard to see. He
looks like nothing so much as a
little brown heap of dead leaves,
and that was the way he was
looking then. But all the time
he was watching this way and that
way to see what he could discover.
Quite without any warning at all
there was a rustling of leaves
between two of the roots of the
old tree a little way off. Peter
didn’t have to turn his head to
look. You see, his eyes are set
so far back that he can see without
turning his head. What he
saw made him catch his breath
and open his eyes wider than ever.
What do you think it was? Why
it was a little brown baby rolling
and tumbling in the leaves!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Peter had never seen a baby
like it before. While he was
watching and wondering whose
baby it could be, another joined
it. They tumbled and rolled over
each other. They played tug-of-war
with a little stick, each holding
one end. They made believe
bite each other. It was very rough
play, but the rougher it was the
better they seemed to like it.
Peter watched them for a long
time. Then, because he had a
cramp in one of his feet, he moved
ever so little, and in doing so he
rustled the leaves. Instantly the
two brown babies disappeared as
if the earth had swallowed them
up. Peter waited, but they didn’t
appear again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last his curiosity proved too
much for him. He hopped over
to the spreading roots of the old
tree and there was the nicest little
doorway he had ever seen. He
knew then where the two brown
babies had disappeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder,” muttered Peter,
“whose babies those were. I wonder—”
A sudden thought popped
into his head. It made him jump
right up in the air. “Do you
suppose that those could have been
Little Joe Otter’s babies?” he exclaimed
right out loud to nobody
in particular. Then, because he
was so full of his discovery, he
scampered away to the dear Old
Briar-patch to tell Mrs. Peter all
about it.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Peter Rabbit</span> could not keep
away from the Green Forest. No,
Sir, he couldn’t. He just couldn’t
do it. You see, having discovered
those two queer, brown babies
under a big tree on the bank of
the Laughing Brook, he just had
to go back there every chance he
could get to watch them. So,
whenever he could, he slipped over
there to watch. He kept as still
as still could be, and not once did
those little brown babies suspect
that he was near. Every day they
came out to play, but at the least
sound they would disappear in that
snug home, the doorway of which
was between the roots of the big
tree.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a little Peter discovered
that there was a school in the
Green Forest, just as there was a
school at Johnny Chuck’s home in
the Old Orchard, and another
where Danny Meadow Mouse had
his home on the Green Meadows.
You see, wherever there are babies
there has to be a school. This is
one of the laws of Old Mother
Nature. Peter had been quite
right when he had guessed that
these babies were the children of
Little Joe Otter. At first they
seemed to do nothing but tumble
over each other and play; it was
very rough play, the roughest play,
that Peter ever had seen. He
didn’t guess that in that play
those two brown babies were
learning something, but they
were. They were learning how
to use their legs and teeth and
bodies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first Peter had seen nothing
of Little Joe Otter or Mrs. Joe,
but he noticed that at the least
rustle of a leaf the two brown
babies disappeared in their home,
and by this he knew that they had
been taught that great law of all
the little wild people, which is that
safety is the first and most important
lesson to be learned.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='t28'></a>Then one morning he saw Mrs.
Joe out with the two babies, and
they were having a grand frolic.
Mrs. Joe would get hold of one
end of a stick and the two little
Otters would get hold of the other
end of the stick and try to pull
it away from her. In this way
they were learning how to grow
strong and to take care of themselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Mrs. Joe took them a
little way into the woods. It just
happened that Reddy Fox had
been along that way the night before.
She showed them his tracks
and made them smell of them, and
when she did this she growled, and
thus they knew that Reddy was an
enemy to be watched out for.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Later, right in the midst of one
of their grand frolics, Sammy Jay
suddenly began to scream. Peter
knew perfectly well what that
scream meant. He knew by the
noise that Sammy had discovered
somebody in the Green Forest.
Of course Mrs. Otter knew, and
right away she chased her two
brown babies into their home and
followed them. Thus they learned
that a screaming Jay is a warning
to watch out for danger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One thing puzzled Peter very
much. He knew that Little Joe
Otter lives in the water most of
the time, and that of course Mrs.
Joe does the same thing. “I
wonder why those youngsters are
not taught to swim,” thought
Peter. “I should suppose that
a swimming lesson would be one
of the very first things they would
get.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Peter puzzled over this a great
deal as one day followed another
and still the Otter babies never
once went near the water. They
grew fast, and had the very best
times ever were, but always on the
land. In fact, Peter suspected by
the way they acted that they didn’t
like the water any better than he
did, and you know he doesn’t like
it at all. Mrs. Otter, and sometimes
Little Joe, brought them fish
to eat, and sometimes their mother
took them on little short hunting
trips, but always on the land. It
was too much for Peter; it seemed
to him that those Otter children
were being brought up altogether
wrong.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>One</span> morning Peter Rabbit was
a little late in getting over to the
home of Little Joe Otter. When
he got there, there was not a sign
of the two brown Otter children at
the doorway of their home between
the roots of the big tree. “It
must be,” thought Peter, “that they
have gone off hunting. I wonder
if I can find them if I look for
them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just then his ears caught the
sound of splashing in the Laughing
Brook. Very, very carefully
Peter crept over where he could
see what was going on. Such a
funny sight as it was! There in
the water were Little Joe and Mrs.
Joe, diving and swimming and
splashing as only they can. On
the bank were the two Otter children,
watching with their eyes
round with wonder, and a great
longing. At the same time it was
very clear to Peter that those two
youngsters were afraid of the
water. Little Joe and Mrs. Joe
kept calling to them to come in,
but they wouldn’t.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No, Sir, those little Otters
wouldn’t more than wet their feet.
Mrs. Joe swam over to where
they were and coaxed them, as only
a mother can. It was of no use.
All the coaxing in the world
couldn’t overcome their fear of the
water. Then she pretended to be
very angry, and she ordered them
to follow her. They whimpered
and cried, but not one step into
the water would they go. Then
she tried making fun of them, but
she was no more successful than
before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were afraid. Yes, Sir,
they were afraid. There was no
doubt about it. Peter doesn’t
like the water himself, but when
he has to he can swim. He
couldn’t remember ever having
been as much afraid of the water
as those two Otter children, not
even when he was a very little
fellow. And that seemed funny,
too. In fact, Peter couldn’t
understand it at all. Here were
two babies whose father and
mother were among the best
swimmers in the world, and yet
they couldn’t get their two youngsters
into the water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally, with a great deal of
coaxing, Mrs. Otter got one of them
to take a ride on her back.
Then she gave the other a ride.
For a long time they swam around
and around, and had a beautiful
time. The babies liked this. You
see, they felt perfectly safe, and
it was great fun to be carried
about, here and there and everywhere.
Then, without the least
bit of warning, while both babies
were on her back Mrs. Joe dived.
Now of course when she did this, it
carried the two babies right under
water, and the minute they went
under water they let go and came
to the top.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My, my, my, what a frightened
pair they were! They blew the
water out of their noses, and both
began to whimper and cry. But
at the same time both began to
paddle as fast as ever they could.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Little Joe and Mrs. Joe popped
their round brown heads out of
water and swam just ahead of the
two babies. The two babies did
their very best to get on the backs
of Little Joe and Mrs. Joe. But
the latter kept just out of their
reach. Then one of the babies
stopped crying. He had discovered
something; he had discovered
that he was swimming, and that
swimming was really great fun.
Somehow that water didn’t seem
so dreadful any more. Then the
other discovered the same thing.
They had had their first swimming
lesson and had found that mother
and father were right after all; the
water wouldn’t hurt them. When
at last they scrambled up on the
shore and shook the water from
their little brown coats, their eyes
were shining with pride and excitement.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Of</span> course Peter Rabbit hadn’t
been able to keep to himself the
fact that Little Joe Otter had a
home and wife and two lively
babies. He just <span class='it'>had</span> to tell the
other Quaddies. Those who dared,
and could go so far into the Green
Forest, visited the little pool in
the Laughing Brook. But they
were very quiet about it. You
see, though they were not exactly
bashful, they had a feeling that
Little Joe might not like visitors,
and most of them had a great deal
of respect for Little Joe’s sharp,
strong teeth. No one willingly
quarrels with Little Joe Otter.
Sammy Jay, of course, had nothing
to fear in the tree tops, but
soon discovered that as soon as it
was known that he was about,
there was nothing to see. So after
that Sammy came silently and took
the greatest care to keep hidden
in the thickest part of a hemlock
tree, but one from which he could
peep forth and see all that was
going on below. And so Sammy
watched the merriest sliding party
he ever had seen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sammy had flown over there very
early that morning. So far, he
had had no more than a glimpse
of the Otter children. He knew
all about the children of Peter
Rabbit and Johnny Chuck and
Danny Meadow Mouse. He had
watched them learn the lessons
which it was most important for
them to learn if they would live
to grow up. He had watched
them at play as well as at school.
But of the ways of Little Otters
he knew nothing at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he sat in the tall hemlock
tree and looked down he felt quite
excited. Somehow he had a feeling—he
didn’t know why—that
he was going to see something
worth seeing. So he waited
patiently. It was very beautiful
there in the Green Forest. The
Laughing Brook was dimpling and
smiling where the sunbeams crept
through the tree tops to kiss it,
and it sang merrily as it hurried
on to the Smiling Pool. Somewhere
deeper in the Green Forest
was Melody the Wood Thrush
pouring out his joy in silver notes
that made glad the hearts of
all who heard. Listening, Sammy
was almost jealous. “If I had
as beautiful a voice as that to
go with my beautiful coat there
would be no one in the world to
compare with me,” he thought,
quite forgetting that a beautiful
character is far more to be desired
than a beautiful voice or a beautiful
coat. A splash in the still
little pool below him reminded
him what he was waiting for.
Eagerly he peered down. Little
Joe Otter was just swimming towards
the shore, and at the top
of the bank where it was steepest
and smoothest were Mrs. Joe
and the two Otter children.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Joe stretched herself flat,
gave a kick with her feet, and
away she slid, headfirst down the
bank and splash into the water.
The two children poked their heads
over the edge of the bank and
it was very plain that they wanted
to follow but didn’t quite dare.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='t42'></a>“Come on, children!” cried Mrs.
Joe, splashing and diving and swimming
round and round.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But still the youngsters were
afraid. By this time Little Joe
had climbed back up the bank.
“This is the way to do it,” said
he, and down the bank he went,
splash into the pool.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of the youngsters stretched
himself out at the top of the slide
as he had seen Little Joe and
Mrs. Joe do, but he couldn’t quite
make up his mind to kick off.
Right then something so funny
happened that Sammy Jay nearly
gave himself away by laughing
right out. The other little Otter
just gave the first one a push and
down he went. You see, when
he once started he couldn’t stop.
He clawed and tried frantically to
stop, but down he went, splash
into the water. It was very, very
funny. It was still more funny
to see his face when he came up
and shook the water from his eyes.
He was proud and excited and
he had lost all fear. In another
minute he was scrambling up the
bank to try it again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had gone down the slippery
slide five times before the other
had found courage enough to try
it. And then such fun! First
Little Joe Otter, then Mrs. Joe,
and after her the two youngsters,
one right at the heels of another,
slid down and splashed into the
little pool until they were so tired
that they just had to lie down
to rest. Never was there such
fun. Sammy Jay was almost envious
again.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Farmer Brown’s</span> boy with his
rod and a can of worms was making
his way to the Laughing Brook.
He felt good all over, did Farmer
Brown’s boy. He felt good because
it was the kind of a day to
make any one feel good. And he
felt good because it was a holiday
for him and he knew that he had
earned it. He had worked hard in
the hayfield for days and days, and
in the cornfield and in the garden,
and never once had he complained.
You see, he knew that the work
just had to be done. That morning
at breakfast Farmer Brown had
given him a surprise. It was
such a splendid surprise! He had
told him that that day was to be
his very own in which to do just
what he wanted to do. Do you
wonder that he felt good all over?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The very first thing he thought
of was fishing. He just <span class='it'>knew</span> that
the speckled trout were waiting for
him to catch them. And now he
was on his way with a lunch in his
pocket and joy in his heart, so
much joy that it was bubbling out
in the merriest of whistles. As he
made his way through the Green
Forest to the Laughing Brook, it
seemed to him that all the little
people he saw by the way were
glad because he was glad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now there was a certain quiet
pool deep in the Green Forest
where Farmer Brown’s boy was
certain he would find hungry trout.
He hadn’t the smallest doubt of it.
More than once he had looked
down in that clear pool and seen
big trout there, and he was sure
he would find them there now.
So he headed straight for this particular
pool. When he was near
enough he put a fat worm on his
hook and dropped it in the water.
He didn’t doubt that it would be
taken at once by a fat, hungry,
speckled trout.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I ought to catch at least three
in this pool,” said he to himself,
and waited, keeping perfectly
still. Nothing happened. Farmer
Brown’s boy moved the bait about
in the most enticing way he knew
how, and still nothing happened.
He didn’t get so much as a nibble.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is queer,” muttered Farmer
Brown’s boy. “I never have had
to wait so long for a bite in this
pool before.” He continued to
keep perfectly still, as a good fisherman
should, and waited patiently.
Still there wasn’t a nibble. Presently,
having nothing else to do, he
began to take note of things, the
trees, the flowers, the humming insects
and at last the opposite bank,
which was steep and smooth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Looks as if something had
been sliding down there,” he muttered.
“Wonder what it could
have been. Funny the trout don’t
bite. I hate to give up, but guess
I’ll have to. I’ll go down to the
next pool and try my luck there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So he trudged down to the next
pool and a pair of sharp eyes
watched him go. They were the
eyes of Sammy Jay, and Sammy
was chuckling under his breath.
You see, he knew why Farmer
Brown’s boy had caught no fish.
The pool which he had just left
was the very pool in the bank of
which Little Joe Otter and Mrs.
Otter had their home, and now
there were no fat trout there.
Little Joe and Mrs. Joe had caught
all of them. They are especially
fond of trout.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Farmer Brown’s boy knew
nothing of this. In fact, he knew
very little about Little Joe Otter
anyway. So he trudged on, sure
that he would have better luck in
the next pool. Sammy Jay followed,
still chuckling. He seemed
to find something a great joke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are smarter fishermen
in this brook than you, and I
wouldn’t give much for all the fish
you will catch,” he remarked to
no one in particular. But he was
looking at Farmer Brown’s boy,
who still had no luck.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Farmer Brown’s</span> boy hadn’t had
one bite, not one teeny, weeny nibble,

such bad luck as this.</p>

<p class='line0'>To see if he is on a hook.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>Farmer Brown’s boy said this
over twice as he tossed his bait
into the second little pool. Then
he waited. He waited and waited
and waited! All good fishermen
wait and wait and wait. To catch
fish patience is as necessary as bait.
So Farmer Brown’s boy waited.
Nothing happened; nothing at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder if some one has been
here before me and caught all the
trout,” thought he. “I didn’t get
a nibble at the first pool and I
haven’t had a nibble at this pool.
Guess I’ll have to move on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So he moved on towards the
third pool a little farther down the
Laughing Brook. He had almost
reached it when he heard a splash
and then another splash. He put
down his rod and crept forward
very, very carefully, so as to make
no sound. When he could see the
little pool clearly he caught his
breath. Other fishermen <span class='it'>were</span>
ahead of him. In fact, a family
fishing party was right in that
very pool and having better luck,
much better luck, than he had had.
The members of that party were
catching fish, the very trout he
had been so sure of catching when
he started out. These were the
ones who had spoiled his fishing.
Have you guessed who they were?
They were Little Joe Otter, Mrs.
Joe and the little Otters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Farmer Brown’s boy kept perfectly
still and held his breath.
He forgot all about his own fishing.
He had seen Little Joe only once or
twice before, and then had caught
only a glimpse of his brown head
in the Smiling Pool. Of course he
had never seen Mrs. Joe or the two
children.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Little Joe dived. He was gone
so long that Farmer Brown’s boy
began to wonder what had become
of him. Suddenly his brown head
popped up and in his mouth was a
beautiful, speckled trout, a trout
that Farmer Brown’s boy would
have been delighted to have
caught.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gee!” exclaimed Farmer
Brown’s boy under his breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Little Joe swam with the trout
straight over to where the two
little Otters were waiting on a big
flat stone at the edge of the water,
fairly dancing with excitement.
Just before he reached them,
Little Joe dropped that fish. It
could still swim, though not very
fast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Splash! The two young Otters
were in the water after it, each
eager to be the one to catch it.
They were clumsy and overeager,
and you know overeagerness often
is quite as bad as being too slow.
Each got in the way of the other.
The fish twisted and turned and
they tried to follow. At last, one
of them made a lucky dash and
proudly turned towards the bank
with the fish in his mouth. Very
proud he looked. The other
swam after and tried to take the
fish away from him. It looked
very much as if there might be a
fight right there in that little
pool in the Laughing Brook. But
just then Mrs. Joe interfered. She
swam in between the two and
pushed the unsuccessful one away.
He went off by himself and sulked
while the other dragged his prize
out on a rock and began to eat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few minutes later Mrs. Joe
caught another trout and this she
carried to the little Otter who had
none. When she let the fish go,
it could swim only a little and so
the young Otter had no trouble in
catching it. Farmer Brown’s boy
wondered if it was just chance that
those fish were alive, or if they had
been kept so purposely to give the
young Otters a lesson in fishing.
I wonder too. Don’t you?</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Farmer Brown’s</span> boy watched
the family fishing party until it
moved on to the next pool. Then
he remembered his own fishing and
the fat trout he had promised to
bring back for supper that night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now I understand why I
haven’t had a bite,” he chuckled.
“Little Joe Otter and his family
got started earlier than I did.
They are welcome to all they have
caught, for the fun of seeing those
young Otters get their first fishing
lesson is worth more to me than
any fish could be. But I can’t allow
them to get <span class='it'>all</span> the fish. I
could frighten them away, but I
don’t want to do that. No, Sir, I
don’t want to make them afraid of
me. I know what I’ll do; I’ll
circle around through the woods
and get ahead of them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Farmer Brown’s boy tramped
around through the Green Forest
until he reached the Laughing
Brook again at a point where he
felt sure of being ahead of the
Otter fishing party. In a minute
there was a sharp tug at his line
and presently he pulled out a
silvery, speckled trout. Then
Farmer Brown’s boy forgot all
about everything but fishing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now it just happened that that
very morning Old Man Coyote had
taken it into his head to visit the
Laughing Brook and see what was
going on there. It may be that in
the back of that shrewd head of
his was an idea there might be
some helpless young babies or
headstrong and careless young children
of one kind or another who
would furnish him with a tender
and easily gotten breakfast. Anyway,
he was going up the Laughing
Brook and Farmer Brown’s
Boy was going down the Laughing
Brook. Of course they met.
However, Farmer Brown’s boy
didn’t know it. He didn’t know
a thing about it. You see, he was
so intent on fishing that he had no
eyes for anything but the water
and his fishing line. So he didn’t
see Old Man Coyote. But Old
Man Coyote saw him and lifted his
lips from his long, strong teeth in
a most unpleasant manner as he
sneaked past through the brush.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Probably he has frightened
everybody along the Laughing
Brook,” grumbled Old Man Coyote
bitterly, as he went on his way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he had gone only a
short distance after passing Farmer
Brown’s boy when his sharp ears
heard a faint splash in a little pool
just ahead. Instantly he dropped
flat on his stomach and began to
crawl forward an inch at a time,
his eyes blazing with eagerness and
his pointed ears cocked forward.
Presently he saw Little Joe Otter
and Mrs. Joe swimming, and a
great disappointment swept over
him. He knew that they were far
too smart to be caught by him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A moment later he saw the two
young Otters. All his disappointment
was forgotten and the eager
look returned to his eyes. He
couldn’t imagine anything more to
his liking than young Otter. His
mouth watered. He licked his
lips hungrily. Inch by inch he
crept nearer. One of the young
Otters climbed up the bank almost
in front of him. Old Man Coyote
wriggled nearer. He brought his
hind feet under him, ready for
a quick spring. Then he waited.
He wanted that young Otter, but
he was too crafty to risk a fight
with Little Joe Otter and Mrs. Joe
unless he had to. So he waited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently Little Joe and Mrs.
Joe called the two children and
started down the Laughing Brook.
The young Otter in the water
obeyed instantly, but the one on
the bank didn’t. He was tired
and he wanted to rest. The others
could go if they wanted to, for
they wouldn’t go far and he could
soon catch up with them. He
rather liked the idea of being left
alone. It made him feel more independent.
There was nothing to
fear. So he sat still and watched
the others disappear around a turn
in the Laughing Brook. When
they were out of sight he chuckled.
He thought himself very smart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A very tiny noise behind him,
the rustle of a leaf, caused him to
turn his head. He had just time
to get a glimpse of fierce, yellow
eyes and gleaming teeth. Then
the paws of Old Man Coyote
landed on him. He was caught!</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> foolish little Otter, who
hadn’t minded his father and
mother but had remained behind
on the bank of the little pool in
the Laughing Brook, didn’t have
time to even squeal before Old
Man Coyote had him. Old Man
Coyote didn’t kill him at once,
as he might have done with one
crunch of his great jaws. He
wanted to play with him a little first.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, though Old Man Coyote
thought that no one saw him,
some one did. It was Sammy Jay.
Sammy had been following the
Otter family, keeping very still
and taking the greatest pains to
keep out of sight himself. You
see, he was very much interested
in those Otter children and he
thought it great fun to watch them
having their first lessons in fishing.
So he was right where he could
see perfectly what happened. The
instant Old Man Coyote sprang
from his hiding-place Sammy knew
that the little Otter hadn’t a
chance in the world unless he
could do something. Right away
he remembered Farmer Brown’s boy
fishing just a little farther down
the Laughing Brook. “Perhaps,”
thought Sammy, “if I scream loud
enough and long enough, he will
come to see what all the fuss is
about.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Sammy opened his mouth
and began to scream at the top
of his lungs. “Thief! Thief!
Thief!” he screamed, flying down
just over Old Man Coyote’s head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Old Man Coyote looked up
and snarled angrily. “Stop your
noise!” he snapped. “This is
none of your business.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thief! Thief! Thief!” screamed
Sammy louder than ever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now the very instant that Sammy
began to scream Little Joe
Otter and Mrs. Joe, who were
just around a turn in the Laughing
Brook, knew that an enemy
was near. For the first time they
missed the little Otter who had
remained behind. Little Joe didn’t
wait a second. He started back
as fast as he could swim, which
is very fast indeed. Mrs. Joe
followed as soon as she had seen
that the other little Otter was in
a safe hiding-place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Old Man Coyote was still snarling
at Sammy Jay when he saw
Little Joe coming, and behind him
Mrs. Joe. He knew then that
he was to have a fight, but he
had no intention of giving up that
little Otter. He backed away,
dragging the little Otter with him
and showing all his great teeth
in ugly snarls. Meanwhile Sammy
Jay kept up his screaming.
Of course Farmer Brown’s boy
heard it. He stopped fishing to
listen. He knows the ways of
Sammy Jay, does Farmer Brown’s
boy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Something going on back there,”
he muttered. “Wonder what it is.
Sammy doesn’t scream like that
unless he is terribly excited. Guess
I’ll have to see what it all
means.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laid his rod down, leaving
the bait in the water. Very carefully
he tiptoed back to where
Sammy was making such a racket.
He was just in time to see Little
Joe and Mrs. Joe rushing at Old
Man Coyote, who was growling
and snarling, while with his two
fore feet he held down the whimpering
little Otter. Farmer Brown’s
boy didn’t stop to think. He
just opened his mouth and yelled.
Then picking up a stick he rushed
forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Old Man Coyote didn’t wait
for him to get there. At the
sound of that yell he jumped as
if he had been shot. Then he
turned and vanished like a shadow
in the brush. Little Joe Otter
and Mrs. Joe had been almost as
much frightened as Old Man Coyote,
and they ran too. But they
didn’t run far. Oh, my, no!
Their love was too strong for that.
They dived into the little pool,
but almost at once their brown
heads appeared again, as they
turned to see what new danger
threatened their darling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for the latter, he was too
badly frightened to move. He
growled feebly in a very frightened
way as Farmer Brown’s boy picked
him up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You poor little thing,” said
Farmer Brown’s boy gently. “I
wouldn’t hurt you for the world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the little Otter couldn’t
understand a word and just shivered
with fear. At first Farmer
Brown’s boy thought that he would
take the little fellow home for a
pet. Then he looked down into
the little pool straight into the
eyes of Mrs. Joe, and he saw there
such a look of anxious love and
longing that he marched straight
down to the edge of the water and
gently put his little captive in it.
Then he laughed and the laugh
was good to hear as the little
fellow dived and swam out to
join his parents as fast as ever
he could, and all three promptly
disappeared. When he got back
to where he had left his rod something
was tugging at the line. It
was the biggest trout he ever
had caught.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Summer</span> had passed and winter
had brought the first snow. Peter
Rabbit likes snow. That is, he
likes it if there isn’t too much of it.
Sometimes, when it is very deep,
Peter has a hard time getting
enough to eat. But when it isn’t
too deep he likes it. You see,
Peter is full of curiosity, and when
there is snow on the ground and it
isn’t crusted over, he is able to
learn many things about his neighbors.
All he has to do is to follow
their tracks to find out where
they have been and what they
have been doing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So with the coming of the first
snow Peter hurried over to the
Green Forest, and as soon as he
got there he began to look for
tracks. The first he found were
the dainty little footprints of
Whitefoot the Wood Mouse.
They were almost as dainty as the
tracks of birds. He followed them
until they were joined by bigger
tracks. Then Peter stopped. He
suddenly lost interest. You see,
those bigger tracks he recognized
right away. They were the footprints
of Reddy Fox. Peter
decided that this was no place for
him, for he knew that those footprints
were made only a very short
time before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So away went Peter in quite
another direction. Presently he
found footprints very like his own,
only very much bigger. They
were the footprints of his cousin,
Jumper the Hare. “I haven’t
seen Cousin Jumper for a long
time, so I guess I’ll see if I can
catch up with him,” thought
Peter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He hurried, lipperty-lipperty-lip,
following the trail of Jumper. It
wound this way and that between
the trees, and crossed and recrossed.
Gradually it led towards
the Laughing Brook. Suddenly
Peter sat up and stared round-eyed
at another trail that crossed the
trail of Jumper. It was a queer
trail. It was the queerest trail
Peter ever had seen. There were
footprints, but they were queer
footprints. They were quite
round, and following straight along
with them was a little furrow in
the snow. Peter guessed right
away that this was made by a
tail. That would mean that the
maker of the tracks had short legs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Right away Peter forgot all
about his cousin, Jumper the
Hare. He was all curiosity to find
out who had made this queer trail.
He turned and followed it.
Presently he came to where there
was a gentle slope. There the
footprints ended, but there was a
long furrow clear down to the
bottom of the slope. It was as if
something had been pushed or
dragged down the slope through
the snow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Peter hurried on. At the bottom
of the slope he found the footprints
again. He noticed that this
trail always followed the easiest
way. It never led over logs or
stumps, but always around them.
By and by he came to another of
those long furrows in the snow.
He stopped to study it. He
scratched a long ear with a long
hind foot. He scratched the other
long ear with the other long hind
foot. He was puzzled. He was
very much puzzled. He didn’t
know what to make of this long
furrow without any footprints.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The only way to find out,” he
decided, “is to catch up with the
one who has made this trail.” So
he hurried on, lipperty-lipperty-lip.
And so at last he came to the top
of a steep bank at the bottom of
which ran the Laughing Brook.
Beginning at the top of this bank
was another one of those queer
furrows. It ended down below at
the edge of the water. Peter
looked across the Laughing Brook.
He could see no trail on the other
side. He looked everywhere, but
could see no signs of that trail. It
simply ended right there at the
Laughing Brook.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Peter Rabbit</span> sat at the top of
the steep bank of the Laughing
Brook in the Green Forest, as puzzled
a Rabbit as ever lived. The
queer trail he had followed ended
in this long furrow straight down
the steep bank to the water.
Peter hadn’t the least idea who
had made that queer trail. So he
sat there, staring all about rather
foolishly, and now and then
scratching a long ear with a long
hind foot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello, Peter Rabbit! Isn’t
this great weather? Don’t you
just love it? I do,” said a voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Peter stared all around, everywhere
but in the right direction.
Finally he just happened to look
down in the black, cold water of
the Laughing Brook. There in
the very middle of it he saw a
brown head with a pair of bright
eyes full of mischief looking up at
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Little Joe Otter!” cried Peter.
“Goodness, how you startled me!
I couldn’t tell where that voice
came from. Yes, this is fine
weather. I like it too. But I
hope it won’t get any colder.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t care how cold it gets,”
declared Little Joe Otter. “By
the way, what brings you over here
to the Laughing Brook?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That reminded Peter of the
queer trail that had so puzzled
him. “Some one, I haven’t the
least idea who, has been traveling
about in the Green Forest, and has
left the queerest trail I’ve ever
seen,” said he. “In parts of it
there are no footprints at all;
there is just a long furrow in the
snow. Here is one of those furrows
right down this bank.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Little Joe Otter’s bright eyes
twinkled. “That is queer,” said
he. “Now who under the sun do
you suppose could have made it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what I want to know,”
declared Peter. “But I guess I’ll
have to keep on wanting, for I
don’t see that trail coming out of
the water anywhere.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll have to have a little closer
look at that. I’ll join you in a
minute,” said Little Joe Otter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He swam swiftly up the Laughing
Brook and came out of the
water where the bank was low.
Then he made his way around
up to where Peter was sitting.
“That is a queer trail,” said
he, trying to keep his eyes from
twinkling. “It looks to me as if
some one had slid down there. I
tell you what, Peter, let’s slide
down, too, and see how it seems.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, thank you,” replied Peter
promptly, and backed away in a
rather undignified manner. Just
looking at that cold, black water
made him chilly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, come on, Peter! It is
the greatest fun in the world!”
cried Little Joe, and giving a
quick, hard push with his hind feet
he glided right down that furrow
flat on his stomach straight into
the water. Peter looked over at
the trail Little Joe had made getting
up there. Then in a flash he
understood. That trail which had
puzzled him so was made by Little
Joe Otter himself. He had made
those queer furrows by sliding on
his stomach in the same way that
he had gone down that bank.
Peter gave a happy little sigh.
His curiosity was satisfied.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Peter Rabbit</span> was so tickled
over having discovered who made
the queer trail in the snow that
he quite forgot to look down in
the Laughing Brook to see where
Little Joe Otter went to. When
he did think to look, Little Joe
was nowhere to be seen. Peter
waited awhile, hoping that Little
Joe would return. He wanted
to see him slide down that bank
again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last Peter decided that Little
Joe had gone home, and that there
was no use sitting on the snow-covered
bank of the Laughing
Brook any longer. He was just
turning away when he heard a
splash from the Laughing Brook.
He stopped to look up stream.
At once he saw four swimmers
coming down the Laughing Brook
and appearing to have no end of
fun as they rolled over in the water,
dived, swam under water, and
moved swiftly along, with just
their heads showing. They were
Little Joe Otter, Mrs. Otter, and
their two nearly grown children.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When they reached the place
where Peter had first seen Little
Joe climb out and up the bank,
Little Joe made straight for shore.
You remember that the bank
was low there. Out he scrambled.
Out behind him scrambled Mrs.
Otter. Out behind her scrambled
one of the young Otters, and out
behind this one scrambled the other
young Otter. Then, following the
trail Little Joe had made in the
snow, they came straight up along
the bank towards where Peter was
sitting. Peter suddenly felt bashful.
He retreated rather hurriedly
to the shelter of a snow-covered
hemlock bough. He couldn’t help
a suspicion that one of those Otters
might suddenly think that a
Rabbit dinner would taste good.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Little Joe led the way to the
edge of the steep bank where
Peter had watched him slide down.
With a quick, hard kick of his
hind feet he disappeared down
that bank and a second later Peter
heard a splash in the water. Then
Mrs. Otter did the same thing, and
the two young Otters followed.
Peter remained right where he
was. In a few minutes he saw
Little Joe Otter coming back up
the trail again. And behind him
came Mrs. Otter and the two young
Otters. “I do believe they’re going
to slide again,” thought Peter.
“I must get where I can watch
them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Peter crept out of his hiding-place
and over to the edge of
the bank, where from a safe distance
he could watch Little Joe
and his family. Again, flat on
his stomach, Little Joe came sliding
down that furrow in the snow
straight into the Laughing Brook.
One of the young Otters couldn’t
wait for Mrs. Otter to go down in
that same furrow and made a furrow
of his own. The other followed
right at his heels. Then there was
a great swimming race to see who
could get back to the low place
on the bank first, and then another
race through the snow to get to
the top of the slide.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such a merry coasting party as
that was. Every time one of those
Otters disappeared in the black,
cold-looking water, Peter shivered.
He just couldn’t help it. But
there was no shivering on the part
of Little Joe and his family. Not
a bit of it! They appeared to
enjoy those plunges into the water
quite as much as they would have
had it been a midsummer day. The
more they slid the better the slide
became and the faster they went.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on and join us, Peter!”
cried Little Joe, as he kicked off
and went shooting down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Peter shook his head. He did
it a little wistfully. Those Otters
were having such a merry time
that Peter envied them. But every
time he looked at that water, so
cold and black, he shivered. The
coasting part might be all right,
but Peter preferred to try it where
there was no water at the end of
the slide.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Rough</span> Brother North Wind
and Jack Frost had been down
from the Far North for some time
now. The pond of Paddy the
Beaver, the Smiling Pool, and the
Laughing Brook, excepting where
it ran swiftly, were covered with
ice. The Green Meadows and the
Green Forest and the Old Pasture
were deep with snow. Only those
who, like Johnny Chuck and
Nimble Heels the Jumping Mouse
and Striped Chipmunk and Bobby
Coon, were asleep in their snug
homes, or, like Paddy the Beaver
and Jerry Muskrat, had plenty to
eat close by their houses, had
nothing to worry about. Those
who had to hunt for their food
were having a hard time of it.
They always do in winter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Little Joe Otter and his family
had cause for worry. You know
they live on fish. But now they
were having to work as they never
had before to get enough to eat.
You see, they had been fishing so
long in the Smiling Pool and
along the Laughing Brook that
fish were becoming scarce. It was
the morning after the coasting
party that Little Joe and Mrs.
Otter went without breakfast that
the two young Otters might eat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear,” said Little Joe,
“this is the poorest fishing I have
ever known. So much of the
Laughing Brook is frozen over
that only a few places are left in
which we can fish. And we have
already caught most of the fish in
those places. We have got to do
something about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been thinking that very
thing,” replied Mrs. Otter. “Shall
we take the youngsters down to
the Big River?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know of another brook, a
bigger brook than this, which has
deep spring holes in it, and many
places where the water is swift and
does not freeze. We might go
there first,” said Little Joe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it far from here?” asked
Mrs. Otter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Little Joe admitted that it was
very far from there. “But what
of it?” said he. “It will give
the youngsters a chance to see
something of the Great World,
and that will be good for them.
When we reach that brook we can
stay there as long as there is good
fishing, and then follow it down to
the Big River. Then we can come
down the Big River and so back
here to the Laughing Brook.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Otter thought this over for
a few minutes. “Wouldn’t such
a journey over land be dangerous?”
she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you afraid?” asked Little
Joe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not for myself,” snapped Mrs.
Otter rather sharply. “It is the
children I am thinking of.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’ve never been in any
real danger,” said Little Joe. “It
would be a good thing for them
to make a journey on which they
must watch out all the time. It
would teach them how to take care
of themselves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Otter scratched her nose
thoughtfully. “When do we start?”
she asked very suddenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-night,” replied Little Joe
promptly. “It will be moonlight
to-night. Besides, the sooner we
start, the sooner we’ll get a good
meal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re sure you know the
way?” asked Mrs. Otter a bit
doubtfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course,” replied Little Joe.
“Do you think I would propose
going if I didn’t know the way?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So it was decided that the Otter
family would start on a journey
that very night.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='t95'></a><span class='sc'>Gentle</span> Mistress Moon, peeping
down though the tops of the trees
of the Green Forest, saw a queer
procession going up the Laughing
Brook to the pond of Paddy the
Beaver, deep in the Green Forest.
They were Little Joe Otter, Mrs.
Otter, and the two nearly grown
young Otters. Little Joe was leading,
the others following in single
file.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When they reached the pond of
Paddy the Beaver they found it
covered with smooth ice. The
snow had fallen before the pond
had frozen over. Little Joe made
three or four jumps and then threw
himself flat on his stomach and
away he slid on the smooth ice.
As soon as he stopped sliding he
scrambled to his feet and did the
same thing again. The others did
just as he did. They squealed with
delight. It was great fun. And
it was surprising how fast they
went across the pond of Paddy the
Beaver. When they got to the
other side the young Otters didn’t
want to leave that pond. They
wanted to slide some more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But they had been well brought
up, and when Little Joe promised
them that they should have more
sliding before they reached the
end of their journey they said
nothing more. Into the woods,
plowing through the snow, Little
Joe led the way. Every time there
was a little slope he would slide
down to the bottom. Of course
all the others did the same. Sometimes
where it was level he would
make a few swift jumps and then
slide on his stomach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young Otters were much
excited. It was the first time they
had been any distance from the
Laughing Brook. Everything was
strange and new and wonderful.
They wanted to stop to examine
everything. They startled Jumper
the Hare, and as he bounded away
the young Otters started after him
and couldn’t understand why Little
Joe and Mrs. Otter called them
back. Mrs. Grouse whirred out
from under a low hemlock tree and
gave them a great fright. Both
jumped at the roar of those stout
wings. Then, as they saw that
their father and mother hadn’t
even turned their heads, they
looked a little ashamed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Little Joe Otter chose the easiest
way. If he could slip under a
log instead of climbing over it,
he did so. When he couldn’t slip
under it he went around it. But
though he made a trail that was
very winding, he always kept to
a certain direction. It was clear
that he knew exactly where he
was heading for.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now Otters have short legs, and
traveling in the soft snow was tiresome,
even though they could slide
now and then. So at last the two
young Otters began to lag a little.
Traveling was becoming more work
than fun. Little Joe knew just
how they felt. He hadn’t forgotten
his first journey when he
was a youngster. So when at last
he came to a great upturned tree,
he dived into the snow and disappeared.
In a moment he poked
his head out of the hole he had
made.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll stop here for a rest,” said
he, and once more disappeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Otter and the two young
Otters followed him. They found
him in the snuggest, warmest little
cave under the roots of that old
tree. It was just the place to rest
and sleep. In two minutes those
young Otters were curled up and
sound asleep. Little Joe and Mrs.
Otter talked for a few minutes, and
then they, too, curled up.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Yowler</span> the Bobcat, prowling
about through the Green Forest,
came across the trail of the Otter
family. He didn’t have to use his
nose to follow that trail. Any one
with eyes could follow it. The
instant he saw it Yowler knew
who had made that trail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Huh!” muttered Yowler.
“Little Joe Otter has started on
his travels again. I wonder where
he is going this time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Yowler, more from habit
than anything else, put his nose
down in that trail and sniffed. A
surprising change came over him.
He suddenly took great interest
in that trail. He had smelled
<span class='it'>young</span> Otters. Little Joe or Mrs.
Otter he wouldn’t think of attacking.
They were too big and strong,
and he knew too well how they
could fight. But a young Otter
would be a different matter, even
though he might be almost fully
grown. Certainly this was a matter
worth looking into.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So in his usual, sneaking fashion
Yowler followed that trail. And
at length he came to the big upturned
tree and the hole in the
snow that led down under the roots.
Very gently Yowler sniffed. At
once his nose was filled with the
Otter scent. He grinned hungrily.
Those Otters were down there
asleep. It was a great temptation
to dig down and try to surprise
them. But Yowler knew better
than to try this. He looked around.
A short distance away was a
big hemlock tree. Yowler circled
around to it and climbed part way
up. Then he crouched on a big
limb and prepared to wait for
those Otters to come out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He didn’t have long to wait.
He saw the head of Little Joe
Otter pop out of that hole in the
snow. Then Little Joe came out.
He was followed by Mrs. Otter
and then by the two young Otters.
Yowler’s yellow eyes glowed hungrily
as he noticed that one of
these was smaller than the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Little Joe started off at once,
and the others fell in behind him.
Just as soon as he dared to,
Yowler dropped down from that
tree and began to sneak after
them. It was surprising how fast
those Otters traveled. But Yowler
can travel fast, and it wasn’t long
before he had them in sight.
Then he moved more cautiously.
He sneaked from tree to tree and
took advantage of every stump
and bush. For awhile the young
Otters kept close to their parents.
Then from time to time they
dropped back, as they stopped to
examine things that were new to
them. Their curiosity satisfied,
they would bound ahead to catch
up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If that smallest Otter will just
drop far enough behind so that I
can get her alone, I think I’ll have
an Otter dinner,” muttered Yowler.
“Those youngsters have got to see
everything that is to be seen.
They are like all other youngsters,
full of curiosity and heedless.
They probably think they are
quite able to take care of themselves.
It certainly will be worth
while to follow them for awhile.
I haven’t anything better to do.
Besides, I will go a long way for
an Otter dinner.” He licked his
lips and his mouth watered.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Little Joe</span> and Mrs. Otter are
wise in the ways and the things
of the Green Forest. So, as they
journeyed towards the distant brook
they had planned to visit, their
keen ears caught every little sound,
and without bothering to investigate
they knew just what had made
each little sound. But with the
two young Otters it was a very
different matter. Everything was
new and strange and therefore
interesting. They wanted to stop
and examine everything. Every
time they heard a little noise off
at one side they wanted to go
over and find out what had
made it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now Mrs. Otter is a good mother,
a watchful mother. She kept a
keen eye on the two young Otters.
And every time they started off
she called them back. She warned
them that there were dangers in
the Green Forest. She did her
best to frighten them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The smallest Otter was headstrong
and wilful and heedless.
She wanted to have her own way.
“Mother is just trying to scare
us,” she whispered to her brother.
“I don’t believe there is any danger.
We haven’t seen a single
thing to be afraid of. She wants
us to tag along at her heels and
not have any fun. I want to see
all there is to see. She can’t scare
me. I’m not afraid of any one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the smallest Otter kept dropping
behind to examine everything
that interested her. At the same
time she kept a watchful eye on
Mrs. Otter, and every time the
latter turned to see where the
youngsters were, the smallest Otter
would go bounding along the trail,
hurrying to catch up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her brother was more obedient.
He sometimes dropped behind, but
never as far behind as his sister.
Mother Otter, seeing the obedient
young Otter not far behind, would
take it for granted that his sister
was not far behind him, and so
after a while she became a little
less watchful. The smallest Otter
soon discovered this, and then
she dropped farther back than
ever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t get lost,” said she to
herself, “because all I have to do
is to follow this trail through the
snow. I don’t care if they do get
way ahead. I can catch up any
time by hurrying. Now I wonder
what that is. I am sure I saw
something move under that little
tree over to the right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stopped and looked very
hard at the young tree. The
branches were bent down with
snow. She couldn’t see under
them. There was nothing moving
there now. She looked up the
trail. Little Joe and Mrs. Otter
were out of sight, and her brother
was just disappearing over the top
of a little ridge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sure I saw something
move over there,” said the wilful
young Otter, looking back at the
little tree. “I’m sure I did. It
won’t take but a minute to go
over and find out. Mother always
has said that we should learn all
we can. How can we learn if we
don’t try to find out about things?
There certainly won’t be any harm
in looking under that little tree.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once more she glanced along
the trail. Her brother had disappeared.
No one was in sight.
Then she turned and bounded
through the snow towards that
little hemlock tree. She was
going to satisfy her curiosity.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Never</span> was Peter Rabbit more
filled with curiosity than was the
wilful little Otter plunging through
the snow towards a certain little
snow-covered tree. She was sure
that she had seen something move
under that little tree. She hadn’t
the least bit of fear. Never in
her short life had she been in real
danger. Never had she had a
real fright. You see always her
father, Little Joe Otter, or her
mother, had been close at hand.
And of course, with father or
mother near, there was never anything
to be afraid of.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now the lowest boughs of that
little hemlock tree were bent to
the ground by the snow on them.
Under them it was dark. It was
in this darkness that the little
Otter had thought she saw something
move. She kept her bright
eyes fixed on it as she drew nearer.
A few feet from it she stopped
abruptly. In that darkness under
the boughs of the little tree were
two little spots of light. The
young Otter stared and blinked
and stared again. Gradually she
made out a face. The two little
spots of light were two eyes, glowing
with hunger and savage eagerness.
The face was a fierce-looking
face. Never had the young
Otter seen such a fierce-looking
face. For the first time in her life
a chill of fear ran all over her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She no longer had any curiosity.
Whose face it was she was staring
at she hadn’t the least idea. She
didn’t even want to find out.
She suddenly wished she was back
where she should have been with
her father and mother and brother.
She turned and bounded back towards
the trail. The instant she
turned a yellowish-brown form
bounded out from beneath the
young tree. It was Yowler the
Bobcat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Despite the shortness of her
legs, the young Otter moved fast.
But with his longer legs Yowler
moved faster. By the time she
was back on the trail Yowler was
only a jump behind her. Never
was there a more frightened
youngster in all the Great World
than was that young Otter. But
she was no coward. Like a flash
she turned to face Yowler, spitting
and snarling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For an instant Yowler hesitated.
He had hoped to spring on her
back, but he hadn’t been quite
quick enough. She was now
nearly grown, and she was big
enough to fight hard. So Yowler
hesitated. But it was only for a
moment. He knew that she was
young and probably never had
been in a fight. He was quite
willing to be bitten and scratched
a little for the sake of such a
dinner as that young Otter would
make him. So with a snarl Yowler
sprang at her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He tried to seize her by the
throat, but she was too quick for
him. The next instant they were
rolling over and over in the snow,
snarling, spitting, growling, biting
and clawing at each other.
Now Yowler likes to fight on his
back, so that he can use those
great, stout hind feet of his to rip
and tear. But an Otter, like
other members of the Weasel
family, can twist and turn in a
marvelous way. So the young
Otter managed to keep out of
reach of those clawing hind feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such a fight as that was! There
was no longer any fear in that
young Otter. She was simply
fighting mad. But Yowler was
bigger and stronger, and he was
an old fighter. It certainly looked
bad for that wilful, heedless, young
Otter.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Yes</span>, Sir, it certainly looked bad
for that young Otter fighting with
Yowler the Bobcat. It looked very
much as if in the end Yowler would
have that dinner of tender, young
Otter for which he was fighting.
Such a snarling and spitting! Such
a thrashing about in the snow, as
they rolled over and over! Never
had Yowler fought harder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But though he was so busy with
teeth and claws, he never once
forgot to keep his ears open. He
never once forgot to listen for
sounds that might warn him of the
approach of Little Joe Otter or
Mrs. Joe. He knew that they
were not so far away but that they
might hear that fight. So it was
with a sudden wrench he tore himself
free, and with a screech of
disappointment and anger bounded
to the nearest tree and climbed
it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was just in time and that
was all. Snarling, her eyes blazing
with anger, Mrs. Joe plunged down
the trail, and behind her came
Little Joe Otter. Had they succeeded
in reaching Yowler, the
Green Forest would have known
him no more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Joe paid no attention to
him. She rushed straight to the
young Otter and began to lick her
wounds and try to comfort her.
She examined her all over to see
how badly she was hurt, as only
an anxious mother could. But
Little Joe made straight for the
tree up which Yowler had climbed.
At the foot of it he glared up and
dared Yowler to come down.
Yowler was licking a badly bitten
paw. Between licks he snarled
and growled and spit at Little
Joe. But he didn’t come down.
No, Sir, Yowler didn’t come down.
He was far too wise to do that.
And so all that Little Joe could
do was to snarl and spit back at
him and tell him what he would
do to him if ever he had the
chance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It didn’t take Mrs. Joe long
to find that the young Otter was
not badly hurt. Her coat was torn
in places and she was very, very
sore, but she was not seriously
hurt. As soon as Mrs. Joe was
sure of this she called to Little
Joe, and regretfully Little Joe left
the foot of that tree and once more
led the way along the trail. This
time Mrs. Joe was the last one.
She kept behind the two young
Otters. She didn’t intend to give
them a chance to get into more
trouble.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for the young Otter, never
was there one more meek. She had
had a lesson she would never forget.
She smarted and ached, but
she knew that she deserved it.
She knew that it was wholly because
of her wilfulness and disobedience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll never, never disobey again,”
she kept saying over and over to
herself. “I’ll never, never disobey
again. I guess I don’t know as
much about the Great World as I
thought I did. Ouch! That fellow’s
teeth and claws were sharp.
I—I—I wish I hadn’t thought
myself so smart. I wonder who
that fellow is, anyway.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before this she had been too
busy to even wonder who she had
been fighting with. But now she
wanted to know who this enemy
was. And so at the first chance
she asked her mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was Yowler the Bobcat,”
replied her mother. “He is the
greatest sneak in the Green Forest.
He wouldn’t have dared to touch
your father or me. I wish we
had been in time to catch him.
There are a lot of people who
would have been thankful to us
if we had.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Little Joe Otter</span> and his family
had traveled many miles from the
Laughing Brook on their way to
that other brook where Little Joe
was sure they would find better
fishing. They had left a deep trail
through the snow. It happened
that this trail was found by an old
trapper, who was tramping through
the woods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Traveling Otter!” he exclaimed,
as soon as he saw that
trail. Then he examined the trail
very carefully. “More than one
has been along here,” he decided.
“What is more, those Otters are
not very far ahead of me. This
trail is very fresh. They’re heading
straight for the pond just
beyond the next ridge. Otter fur
brings high prices these days. If
I can catch up with them, I may
be able to get a skin or two.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked around for a stout
club, and as soon as he had found
one to suit him he hurried along
that trail. He guessed that those
Otters were not hurrying. He
hoped that if he could get near
enough before he was discovered,
he would be able to outrun one
or two of them. So he hurried
on as fast as he could, taking the
greatest care to make as little
noise as possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Little Joe, Mrs. Joe and the two
young Otters had almost reached
the pond when Little Joe’s ears
caught a sound that caused him
to stop and look back along their
trail. He saw that man running.
He recognized him instantly as
one of those two-legged creatures
called men, the only enemies Little
Joe really feared. “We must run
for our lives!” he cried and led
the way, breaking the path through
the snow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then began a race for life. Little
Joe knew that if that man caught
up with them, they would have no
chance for their lives. He knew
all about that pond just ahead.
He knew that at one end there
were springs and that when all the
rest of the pond was covered with
ice, there usually was open water
above those springs. If they could
reach open water they would be safe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such a race as that was! Though
the Otters did their best, they could
not travel as fast through the snow
as the man. He gained on them
with every step. How thankful
Little Joe and Mrs. Joe were that
he had no terrible gun. Had he
carried a terrible gun they would
have had no chance at all. But
even without a terrible gun he
would surely kill them all unless
they could reach that open water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Through the trees they saw the
black, smooth ice of that pond
just ahead of them. They bounded
and plunged ahead with all their
strength. Little Joe was ahead to
break the way through the snow.
Then came the two young Otters,
and Mrs. Joe was last. That
trapper was almost within striking
distance as she sprang out on to
the ice. Out there the Otters could
travel faster than the trapper.
They would make several bounds
forward and then throw themselves
on their stomachs and slide. It
was surprising how fast they traveled
over that ice. But the trapper
couldn’t run fast on the ice. It
was too slippery. He did his best,
but he fell farther and farther behind.
Finally he threw his club
at Mrs. Joe. It just missed her.
A minute later, one after another,
Little Joe and his family disappeared
in the open water. They
had won their race for life.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> trapper who had tried to
run down Little Joe Otter and his
family and kill them with a club
was not one to give up easily. Of
course, he was disappointed at his
failure to get one of those Otter
coats. But he was not at all discouraged.
As soon as Little Joe
Otter and his family had disappeared
in the open water at one
end of that pond, the trapper
stopped running. He was glad to
stop, for he was quite out of
breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Those Otters won’t stay in
this pond long,” said he to himself.
“They know that I know they are
here, so they will move on as soon
as they think they safely can. I
can guess just where they are
bound for. They are bound for
the big brook where there is a lot
of swift water that doesn’t freeze,
and where they will be sure of
good fishing. They will stay there
for some time. That will be the
place to set some traps. The
thing for me to do is to leave them
alone for awhile so that they will
not be at all suspicious. Then
I’ll set some traps. Their fur is
in the best of condition now, and
if I can get two or three of their
skins they will pay me several
times over for all the trouble I
may take to get them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the trapper turned back and
tramped home. He didn’t go back
to that pond for two days. When
he did go back he found just
what he expected to find, and he
chuckled when he found it. It
was a trail in the snow leading
away from that pond in the direction
of the big brook. He followed
it. As he approached the
big brook he was careful to keep
out of sight. He could see that
the trail led straight to the water.
For a long time he remained hidden,
patiently watching. At last
he saw a brown head out in the
water. A moment later one of
the young Otters with a fish in his
mouth climbed out on a big, flat
rock and ate the fish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are there,” chuckled the
trapper, “and they will stay, for
there are plenty of fish there. I
won’t worry them for awhile, but I
will study their habits and find out
where they are in the habit of going
and what their favorite places
are. They will be sure to have a
slide. That will be one place for
a trap. I’ll put it right at the
foot of the slide. I’ll find out
where they are in the habit of
climbing out on the bank to go up
to the top of the slide and I’ll put
a trap there. Perhaps I can discover
the den where they sleep.
That will be another place for a
trap. I suspect that those old
Otters (he meant Little Joe and
Mrs. Joe) have learned a lot about
traps, and it will not be easy to
catch them. But I ought to be
able to catch those two young Otters
without much trouble.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So for a week that trapper
spent most of his time watching
the place where Little Joe and his
family were living, and studying
the signs to learn all he could
about their habits. But all the
time he took the greatest care that
they shouldn’t know he was about.
He knew that if he should be seen
by one of them, Little Joe Otter
would at once become suspicious.
When at last he felt he had learned
all he could he selected a dozen
cruel, steel traps and went over to
set them.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> trapper had found out the
things he wanted to know. He
had found out where the Otters
left the water to climb up to the
top of their slippery slide. He
had found out where they were
in the habit of making a short cut
across from one part of the brook
to another where it made a bend.
He had found certain favorite places
where they brought the fish they
had caught to eat. He felt that
the time now had come to set traps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now this trapper knew that an
Otter has a keen nose and is very
suspicious. He knew that if he
handled those traps with his bare
hands, Little Joe or Mrs. Joe
would be likely to get the dreaded
man smell and would keep away
from those traps. So he took
care not to touch them with bare
hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He first took great care to make
sure that none of the Otter family
were about. Then he set those
cruel traps. One he placed in
the water right at the foot of the
bank where the Otters were in the
habit of climbing out to go up to
their slippery slide. He placed it
in such a way that the first Otter
who tried to climb up that bank
would be sure to step in the trap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the short cut that Little Joe
and his family had made so as not
to have to go way around the bend
he placed two traps, one at each
end of the little path. He covered
them lightly with snow so that
they could not be seen. Other
traps were hidden in a similar
way at places he knew the Otters
often visited. One trap was set
right at the foot of the slippery
slide. There was no bait with
any of these traps. In another
part of the brook, which he knew
the Otters visited occasionally to
fish, traps were set, each baited
with a fish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There,” said the trapper, when
the last trap had been set, “if
those Otters manage to keep out
of all those traps they will prove
themselves to be smarter than I
think they are. This is the first
day of the new year, and unless
I am greatly mistaken, one or
more of those Otters will have a
New Year surprise party.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the trapper hurried away.
He had worked fast, for he didn’t
want to be seen. He knew that
if Little Joe or Mrs. Joe should
see him, they would at once become
suspicious. He was sure that he
hadn’t been seen, and all the
way home he chuckled as he
thought of how clever and smart
he had been. He didn’t once
think of how dreadful it would
be for one of those little people
in brown fur to be caught in
one of those cruel traps. All he
thought about was the money that
one of those brown fur coats would
bring him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While the trapper had been so
busy setting those traps, Little
Joe Otter, Mrs. Joe, and the two
young Otters had been taking a
nap. They knew nothing of the
trapper’s visit to the brook. They
were care-free and happy and life
was very good to them.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Hardly</span> had the trapper disappeared
in the woods when Little
Joe Otter awoke and crept forth
from his hiding-place. He left
Mrs. Otter and the two young
Otters still asleep. Little Joe
yawned, stretched, and then decided
that he wanted a trout. It
didn’t take him long to catch one.
With it in his mouth he swam
straight to a certain old log, one
end of which was in the water.
He intended to climb out on that
old log and eat that trout. It was
his favorite eating place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But just as he reached that old
log and before he had started to
climb out on it, a queer feeling of
uneasiness took possession of him.
He had a feeling that something
wasn’t quite right. Now when
Little Joe has that feeling he always
heeds it. He didn’t climb
out on that log. He turned and
swam over to a flat rock. He
climbed out on that and laid the
fish down. Somehow he had lost
his appetite. He looked long and
hard over at that old log.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It looks all right,” said Little
Joe. “Yes, Sir, it looks all right.
Just the same I have a feeling that
there is something wrong there. I
believe I’ll go back there and
see if I can find out what <span class='it'>is</span>
wrong.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So once more Little Joe swam
to that old log. But he didn’t
climb out on it. He studied it
and studied it. He used both eyes
and nose. Presently he noticed
some fresh mud on that old log.
That was queer. He was sure
there had been no mud there before.
Very carefully he looked
all around the place where that
fresh mud was, and in doing this
he discovered a chain. He got
hold of the chain and pulled
gently. What do you think happened?
Why, he pulled a trap
up out of a place that had been
cut in that old log, and then covered
with mud to hide the freshly
cut wood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha!” exclaimed Little Joe, as
the trap dropped down into the
water beside the old log. “I’ve
been afraid of this ever since we were
chased by that terrible two-legged
creature on our way over here.
He must be the one who set this
trap. If he set this trap, he has set
other traps. I must warn Mrs.
Joe and the children. That trapper
has been watching us. He
knows that I have been using this
old log. He probably knows all
the other places where we are in
the habit of going. We must find
out where those traps are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just then Little Joe heard a
splash in the water. There was
Mrs. Joe with a trout in her mouth.
He called her over there, and
showed her the trap and where it
had been set. “Where are the
children?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are fishing,” replied Mrs.
Otter, with a most anxious look in
her eyes. “We must find them
at once. They never have seen a
trap and they know nothing about
traps. Oh, dear, I hope they will
not get caught before we can find
them and warn them!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just then the smallest young
Otter climbed out on a rock, and
a moment later her brother climbed
out on another rock. Mrs. Otter
and Little Joe swam swiftly over to
them. The young Otters stopped
eating the fish they had caught
to stare in surprise at the way
in which their parents were
hurrying.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>“Do</span> you remember the terrible
two-legged creature who chased
us on our way from the Laughing
Brook to this brook?” Little
Joe Otter asked the two young
Otters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Both nodded their heads. “I
guess I do!” exclaimed one. “He
gave me a dreadful fright.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you seen anything of him
since we have been staying over
here?” Mrs. Joe asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This time both the young Otters
shook their heads. “No,” said
the one who had spoken before.
“The truth is, I had forgotten all
about him. I guess he doesn’t
know we are over here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess he does,” said Little
Joe Otter. “I <span class='it'>know</span> he does.
He has set traps for us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are traps?” asked one
of the young Otters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are terrible things with
awful jaws which are hidden where
they are not likely to be seen and
are always ready to jump up and
seize an Otter by the leg. Then
they will never let go, and there
is no way of making them let
go,” explained Little Joe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The eyes of the young Otters
grew round with wonder and fear.
“But what have they to do with
that terrible creature who chased
us?” asked one of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Those traps belong to him,”
replied Little Joe. “He is the
one who has hidden those traps,
hoping to catch us. If one of
you should be caught in one of
those traps, that terrible two-legged
creature would come and kill you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But how do you know that he
has hidden any of those dreadful
traps around here?” inquired the
smallest Otter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your father has just found
one,” replied Mrs. Joe. “It was
set over on that old log where
your father has been in the habit
of eating his fish. Probably there
are more traps, and so it is not
going to be safe for any of us to go
to the places we have been in the
habit of going. That means that
you must not use the slippery slide
again, not even once. You must
keep away from the bank at the
place where we have been in the
habit of climbing it to reach the
top of the slippery slide. Each of
you must promise not to once use
that little path we have made
across the point to reach that other
bend in the brook.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But can’t we slide any more?”
asked one young Otter, looking
very much disappointed. “There
won’t be any fun if we can’t go
sliding.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is better to go without fun
than to lose your life,” said Little
Joe Otter gravely. “However, we
will make a new slippery slide.
There is one thing more: If one
of you should find a dead fish,
keep away from it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?” demanded one of the
young Otters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because the only safe fish for
an Otter is a live fish. No matter
how hungry you are or how hard
it is to catch a fish, don’t be tempted
by a dead fish. There is likely to
be a trap hidden close by. If the
fishing were not so good here, we
would move on at once. Now
remember to keep away from every
place you have been in the habit
of going to, and don’t touch a dead
fish.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Little Joe Otter</span> took the two
young Otters over to the log where
he had found the trap and showed
it to them. It looked so harmless
that it was difficult for the young
Otters to believe that it was such
a terrible thing as their father said
it was. Then he took them over
to the foot of the slippery slide,
and while they swam about at a
safe distance he looked carefully
until he found a trap right at the
bottom of the slippery slide. He
showed it to them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now you see why I said you
mustn’t go down the slippery slide
even once,” said he. “I didn’t
know that this trap was here, but
I suspected it. I suspect that
there are traps in the other places
I have warned you to keep away
from. If you want to live long
and be happy, don’t once forget
the warnings your mother and I
have given you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young Otters promised they
wouldn’t forget, and then the
whole family went fishing. Of
course, they didn’t go fishing together.
They separated, each one
fishing in a different place. All
the time she was looking for a
trout, the smallest Otter kept
thinking about those traps. She
made up her mind that nothing
would tempt her to be heedless
of the warnings she had been
given. You see, she had not forgotten
the lesson she had learned
when Yowler the Bobcat had
caught her because of her heedless
wilfulness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But her brother had had no such
lesson, and as he hunted for trout
he smiled to himself at what he
thought were the foolish fears of
his parents. “Father and mother
are just trying to scare us,” said he.
“I don’t believe there is anything
to be afraid of as long as that
dreadful two-legged creature isn’t
about. Those traps look perfectly
harmless to me. I’m not afraid of
them. I guess if I use my eyes
and my nose I can find them
without getting into one of them.
I wonder where all the fish have
gone to. My, I’m hungry! I
believe I’ll go farther up the
brook. There is some swift, open
water up there and it hasn’t been
fished much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the young Otter swam to the
upper end of the open water where
he then was, climbed out on the
ice and traveled over this until
he came to another stretch of
open water. He swam along close
to the bank on one side and presently
came to a sort of little pen
of sticks. He didn’t remember
having seen it before, and he looked
at it suspiciously. He swam around
it at a safe distance, and then he
smelled fish. It didn’t take him
long to discover that inside of that
little pen, at the back, was a fat
trout. That trout wasn’t alive.
It seemed to be held by a stick
at the back of that little pen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young Otter remembered
the warning not to touch a dead
fish. But he was hungry, very
hungry, and here was a dinner he
wouldn’t have to take the trouble
to catch. He swam back and
forth in front of that little pen
of sticks and examined them carefully.
He went close to them and
smelled of them. They seemed
nothing but harmless sticks. His
mouth began to water at the smell
of the fish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There isn’t a particle of danger,”
said the foolish young Otter.
“There wouldn’t be a trap way
up here, anyway. I want that
fish and I’m going to have it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Little Joe Otter’s</span> foolish young
son, who had found a dead fish at
the back of a little pen of sticks
on the edge of the water, remembered
the warning to leave dead
fish alone. But he was hungry,
and it wouldn’t take but a second
to get that fish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Father and mother were just
trying to scare us,” he repeated
to himself. “I guess they don’t
realize that I am big enough to
take care of myself. It won’t be
long before I will be leaving them
and going out into the Great World
for myself, anyway. Then I’ll
have to depend on my own judgment.
This fish is just waiting
for me. I don’t know how it
happened to get here, but that
doesn’t make any difference. I
would be a silly fellow to waste
my time hunting for a live fish
when a dead one is waiting for
me right under my nose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So with a look all around to
make sure that no one was watching
him, the foolish young Otter
entered the little pen of sticks
through a narrow opening, his eyes
shining as he reached for the dead
fish at the back of the pen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then something happened!
Yes, indeed, something happened!
Something grabbed the foolish
young Otter by one of his toes!
Yes, Sir, it grabbed him and it
grabbed him tight! What it was
he hadn’t the least idea. But
whatever it was, it hurt dreadfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the young Otter suffered
more from fright than he did from
pain. He twisted around and
plunged for the deep water, but
he was brought up short. The
thing that had grabbed him by the
toe was holding on. He struggled,
but he was held fast. The dreadful
thing was pulling him down
under water. If it should succeed
in holding him down there he
would drown. My, how he did
thrash about and struggle! Even
yet he didn’t know what it was
that was holding him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By and by he had to stop
struggling in order to get his
breath. His foot ached dreadfully.
Without really thinking of what
he was doing, he swam towards
the shore. Then he found that
this thing that had him by the
toe didn’t pull him under water.
He twisted around to see what it
was that was holding him. It
was a cruel, steel trap. He knew
what it was as soon as he saw
it, for his father, Little Joe Otter,
had shown him one that very
morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Right within reach was that
fish which had been the cause of
all this trouble. The young Otter
didn’t even look at it. He, who
had been so hungry a few minutes
before, had lost his appetite. Yes,
Sir, he had lost his appetite completely.
Just then he felt as if
he didn’t care ever to eat again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All he wanted was to get away
from that dreadful trap. He bit
at it, but this only hurt his teeth.
It held him as tightly as ever.
He remembered what Little Joe
Otter had told him, about how if
he should be caught in a trap that
dreadful two-legged creature would
come and kill him. Once more he
began to struggle. He pulled with
all his might. It hurt, but he
kept on pulling. But for all his
pulling he was held fast.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Have</span> you ever been terribly
frightened? Have you ever been
so frightened that you couldn’t
even think? That is the way it
was with the foolish young Otter
when he realized that he was
caught in a trap. He was so
filled with terror that he didn’t
even think about the pain in his
foot. There is nothing quite so
awful as the helpless feeling that
comes when one is caught in a
trap. Had that young Otter been
seized by an enemy twice his size
he would have fought bravely to
the last breath. But one cannot
fight a steel trap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After awhile the young Otter
was so tired out with struggling
that he had to be quiet to get his
breath and to rest. He trembled
all over. Every time he heard the
least little sound he was sure it
was the trapper coming to kill him.
How he did wish he had heeded
the warnings of his father and
mother!</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a long, long, long time he
was held a prisoner by that dreadful
trap. From time to time he
tried to cut the chain that held
the trap, but of course he tried
in vain. His teeth, sharp as they
were, didn’t even scratch the steel
of that chain. He wondered if
his father and mother would miss
him and look for him. He wondered
if they would ever find out
what had happened to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I could only get away from
this thing, I never, never would
disobey again,” he sobbed. “No,
Sir, I never, <span class='it'>never</span> would disobey
again. I do wish father and
mother would come. Perhaps if
they came they could get me free
from this dreadful thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is said that if you wish
long enough and hard enough for
a thing you may get your wish.
Certainly the foolish young Otter
wished long and hard. And at
last he did get his wish. His
father, Little Joe Otter, suddenly
appeared. He was looking for
that young Otter. He had worried
when that young Otter did
not return and had started out
to look for him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Little Joe didn’t scold that
young Otter. Instead, he did the
best he could to comfort him.
The first thing he did was to look
to see how the young Otter was
held by that dreadful trap. He
saw right away that he was held
only by one toe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are lucky, very lucky,”
declared Little Joe Otter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young Otter thought he
was very unlucky. He said so.
He couldn’t see that there was
anything lucky about it. Then
Little Joe explained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That trap,” said he, “has got
you only by one toe. It might
have you by the whole foot. If
it had you by the whole foot,
and that is the way the trapper
meant that it should catch you,
there would be very little hope
for you. As it is, if you pull
hard enough, you may lose your
toe, but that will be all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I don’t want to lose my
toe!” wailed the young Otter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” replied Little Joe.
“If you had rather lose your life
than your toe, there is nothing I
can do about it. You can get
free if you really want to, but the
price of freedom will be that toe.”</p>

make up his mind to it. It seemed
to him a dreadful thing to lose a toe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is losing your toe
compared with losing your life?”
his father asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But perhaps I won’t lose my
life,” protested the young Otter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, you will,” replied Little
Joe Otter. “It is just as certain
as it is that you are now caught in
this trap. I can’t help you; your
mother can’t help you; no one can
help you. That two-legged creature
who set this dreadful trap will
come to see if any one has been
caught in it. Then he’ll kill you.
If you want this to happen rather
than lose that toe, why I may as
well go back to your mother and
sister. It is useless for me to stay
here. There is no knowing when
that trapper may come and he may
have a terrible gun with him. A
good hard pull with all your might
will set you free. I’m going now.
Come on!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young Otter shook his head.
His eyes were filled with tears.
He couldn’t bear the thought of
being left alone, yet he couldn’t
make up his mind to lose that
toe. That toe was numb now.
That trap didn’t hurt so very
much. But he was sure that if
he should try to pull himself free,
it would hurt dreadfully. It was
because of this that he couldn’t
make up his mind to try.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-by,” said Little Joe
Otter, and began to swim away
swiftly. He didn’t even look
back. At first the young Otter
couldn’t believe that he was really
being left alone. But his father
kept straight on. Every second
he was getting farther and farther
away. At last the young Otter
realized that his father had meant
just what he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young Otter stood it just
as long as he could. Then the
thought of being left alone in that
cruel trap became more than he
could bear. He plunged after his
father. The trap brought him up
short. But with all his might he
struggled. He didn’t even notice
the pain. The thought of being
left alone there was worse than
any pain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly that trap let go. At
least he thought it had let go.
He was free! I wish you could
have seen him shoot through the
water. How he did swim! Little
Joe Otter heard him coming and
waited for him. “So you decided
that freedom is worth the price of
a toe,” said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such a funny look as the face of
that young Otter wore. It was
not until then that he realized that
he had left his toe behind.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> young Otter, who had left
a toe behind in a trap, was so
happy to be free again that he
hardly gave the loss of that toe
a thought. The cold water was
good for the sore foot, and as the
young Otter was healthy, his foot
healed rapidly. In fact, in two or
three days his foot was practically
well. But the young Otter didn’t
forget his dreadful experience.
He never would forget it. He
had learned a lesson that he would
remember as long as he lived.
All his life he would be suspicious
of traps and on the watch for
them. Never again would that
young Otter be caught in a trap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course, the trapper found
that toe in his trap. Such a disappointed
trapper as he was!
“There won’t be a chance of
catching that Otter again,” said he.
“I must have been careless in
setting that trap. It should have
caught him by the whole foot and
not just by a toe. Probably those
other Otters know all about it
now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he discovered the new
slippery slide he knew that his
traps at the old slippery slide had
been found. He set another trap
at the foot of the new slide, but
he didn’t have much hope of
catching any one in it. He understood
perfectly that Little Joe
Otter and Mrs. Joe were wise in
the ways of trappers. “I guess,”
muttered the trapper, “that my
best chance of getting one of those
Otters will be to hide for a chance
to shoot one of them. To-morrow
I’ll spend the day over here with
my gun.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So he spent all the next day hidden
near the slippery slide, watching
with his terrible gun. But
he didn’t have a chance to use it.
He didn’t get so much as a
glimpse of a sleek, brown head.
And the reason was that Little
Joe Otter and his family were
far away down the brook. They
had started early the night before.
They were on their way down to
the Big River.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Little Joe and Mrs. Joe had
talked the matter all over. “It
isn’t safe to stay here any longer,”
declared Little Joe. “I don’t like
to leave the good fishing, for we
may not find another place where
it is so easy to get plenty of fish.
But that terrible two-legged creature
will give us no peace. There
is a trap now at the foot of our
new slippery slide.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are quite right, my dear,”
replied Mrs. Otter. “I am worried
to death for fear, in spite of all
their watchfulness, one of the
children will get caught in a
terrible trap and be killed. I
think the sooner we move along
the better. Safety is the most
important thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So once more Little Joe and
his family went traveling. There
was a crust on the snow now,
and they had a lot of fun sliding.
Moreover, they didn’t leave a trail
as when they had left the Laughing
Brook in the soft snow. They
followed the big brook on its way
towards the Big River. Now and
then they came to open places
where the water was swift and
hadn’t frozen. There they stopped
to fish. Sometimes they swam for
quite a distance under the ice.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>At</span> the place where the big
brook, down which Little Joe
Otter and his family had traveled,
enters the Big River, the latter
never freezes over. Little Joe
Otter knew this. You see, he
had been there before more than
once. He knew that there was
good fishing in the Big River,
and that if no trapper discovered
them they would not be disturbed.
No men lived near that part of
the Big River. There was green
forest on both banks. There were
snug, dry, hiding-places, and Little
Joe knew them all. They would
stay until spring and then work
down the Big River and so return
to the Laughing Brook from which
they had started.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young Otters liked this
place. They soon had a fine slippery
slide on which to play when
they were not sleeping or fishing.
It was fun to explore under the
ice along the banks of the Big
River. It was fun to catch a fish
and climb out on the ice to eat
it. There was nothing to worry
about. There were no enemies
to fear. By day as well as by
night they felt perfectly safe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One day the young Otter who
had lost his toe caught an extra
big fish. It was the biggest fish
he ever had caught. He was
very proud of it as he climbed
out on the ice. Now he had
caught that fish more for the fun
of catching it than because he was
hungry. The fact is, he wasn’t
hungry. Fish were plentiful, and
he had already eaten about all he
could. So he merely took a couple
of bites from what he considered
the best part—just back of the
head. Then he saw his sister
over on the slippery slide and
went over to join her, leaving
the big fish on the ice. He
wanted to tell her about that big
fish. He wanted to boast a little.
He was sure that it was a bigger
fish than she ever had caught.
So when he got over to the slippery
slide he at once began to
boast. His sister stood it as long
as she could. Then she declared
that she didn’t believe he had
such a wonderful fish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on over and I’ll show
it to you,” said the young Otter.
“It’s twice as big as any fish
you’ve ever caught.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t believe it,” declared
his sister. “I’ll have to see it
before I’ll believe it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, come on!” cried
her brother, and down the slippery
slide he glided into the water.
Flat on her stomach behind him
went his sister. Together they
climbed out on the ice where the
big fish had been left.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here it——” began the young
Otter, and stopped abruptly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, where is it?” demanded
his sister.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her brother simply stared all
about him with a foolish look on
his face. There was no fish there!
What could have become of it?
He knew that he had killed it
and so it couldn’t possibly have
flopped back into the water. He
ran all around with his nose to
the ice, but there was no scent
of Reddy Fox or of any one else.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t believe you caught a
big fish,” declared his sister.
“You must have dreamed it. If
you caught it, where is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Of</span> all the puzzled people in all
the Great World none was more
puzzled than was the young Otter
whose big fish had disappeared.
He had certainly killed that fish,
He had even taken two big bites
out of the choicest part of it. So
he knew that the fish couldn’t
have flopped off the ice into the
water while he was away. He
had been gone only a few minutes,
just long enough to get his sister
and bring her over to see that big
fish. He had boasted that it was
bigger than any fish she ever had
caught. Now there wasn’t a trace
of it anywhere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His sister tossed her head. “I
don’t believe you caught a big fish
at all,” said she.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I tell you I did,” protested
her brother. “I caught him and
I left it right here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then where is it?” demanded
his sister.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But this the young Otter
couldn’t say. He wished he could.
He had a queer and most uncomfortable
feeling. It made him
uneasy. Actually it made him
afraid. He didn’t know what he
was afraid of, but he was afraid.
So when his sister disgustedly
plunged into the water and swam
back to the slippery slide on the
bank, he followed her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But somehow he couldn’t enjoy
that slippery slide. He kept
thinking about that lost fish. To
make matters worse, his sister kept
teasing him about it. She called
him a boaster. It was clear that
she didn’t believe he had caught
that big fish he had boasted about.
So after going down the slippery
slide a few times, he swam back to
the place where he had left the big
fish. He climbed out on the ice
and once more looked around
everywhere for signs of some one
who might have stolen that big
fish. But not a sign could he
find.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A little way off on the ice was
a little heap of snow. At least
the young Otter thought it was
a heap of snow. He looked at it
carelessly two or three times. But
he didn’t go over to it. He
wasn’t interested in heaps of snow.
The only thing of interest to him
just then was what had become
of that fish. It was very mysterious.
He didn’t like a mystery.
His uneasiness increased, so after
awhile he once more swam away.
He wanted to ask his father or his
mother what could have become
of that fish, but he didn’t. He
was afraid he would be laughed
at. He was afraid that they
wouldn’t believe he had caught
it any more than his sister believed
it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now hardly had that young
Otter disappeared when what he
had taken for a little heap of
snow disappeared too. It disappeared
without a sound. You
see, it was alive. It really wasn’t
a heap of snow at all. If the
young Otter had seen it go, he
might possibly have guessed what
had become of his big fish. But
he didn’t see it go, and the next
time he visited that place he
didn’t even notice that that little
white heap was no longer there.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>So</span> many things happen every
day to the little people of the Green
Forest and the Green Meadows
that they do not think of any
one thing very long. Two days
after the mysterious disappearance
of his big fish the young Otter
had stopped thinking about it.
He had made up his mind that
he never would know what became
of that fish and that the
matter was no longer worth puzzling
over. There were too many
other things to think about and
do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the third day he caught
another fine fish and climbed out
on the ice with it near the place
where he had left the other. This
fish wasn’t so big as the one
that had disappeared, but it was
a fine fish for all that. The young
Otter was hungry and he intended
to eat that fish right there. But
he had taken only a bite or two
when his sharp eyes saw another
fish in the water. Two fish would
be better than one. He dropped
on the ice the fish he was eating,
plunged into the water and like a
brown streak shot after the other
fish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Swift as a fish is in water, there
isn’t much chance for it when once
an Otter gets after it. The young
Otter had quite a chase, but in the
end he caught the fish. Then with
it in his mouth he swam back and
climbed out on the ice at the place
where he had left the first fish.
He was feeling very well satisfied.
With two fish he would have all
he could possibly eat, and more too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“First I’ll eat the one that I
caught first,” said the young Otter,
as he dropped on the ice the one he
had just caught. Then he received
a shock. That other fish wasn’t
there! There was only one fish
and that was the one he had just
caught. He couldn’t believe it.
No, Sir, he couldn’t believe it. He
actually rubbed his eyes two or
three times, to make sure that
nothing was the matter with them.
But nothing was the matter; that
other fish wasn’t there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young Otter hastily looked
in every direction. No one was in
sight. At least he didn’t see any
one. All he saw was what he took
to be a little heap of snow a short
distance away. He looked in the
water. He thought he might have
knocked that fish into the water
when he dived after the other one.
But he looked in vain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course, right away he remembered
the disappearance of
the big fish a few days before.
Now another had disappeared just
as mysteriously. It was unbelievable,
but it was true. The young
Otter became frightened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is no place for me,” said he.
“No, Sir, this is no place for me.
The first thing I know, this fish will
disappear right out of my mouth.
I wouldn’t mind losing the fish so
much if I could only know what
becomes of them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked hastily down to see
if the fish he had just caught was
still at his feet. It was, and with
a little sigh of relief he picked it up
and with it in his mouth plunged
into the water and swam hurriedly
over to the bank. There he gulped
that fish down as fast as ever he
could. He did it as if he feared
that it might disappear before he
could get it eaten.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> young Otter had told his
father, Little Joe Otter, the story
of how his fish had mysteriously
disappeared. You should have
seen the twinkle in Little Joe’s
eyes as he listened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would you really like to know
what became of your fish?” Little
Joe asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I would,” replied the
young Otter. “But I don’t believe
anybody will ever find out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you think I could find
out if I went over there?” asked
Little Joe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young Otter shook his head
very decidedly. “No, I don’t,”
said he very honestly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, son, let’s go fishing,”
replied Little Joe Otter, his eyes
twinkling more than ever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So together they went fishing,
and presently each caught a fish.
“You take yours over to the bank,
but don’t stop to eat it. Keep
your eyes on this fish of mine,”
said Little Joe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young Otter obediently took
his fish over to the bank and then
sat down to watch. Little Joe
Otter climbed out on the ice at the
place where the young Otter had
twice lost his fish. He laid the fish
down on the ice, then plunged into
the water and swam over to where
the young Otter was. Before he
got there, the young Otter saw a
great, broad-winged, white bird
appear as if from nowhere, without
stopping in his flight, pick up that
fish on the ice and fly away a short
distance. Then this great bird
alighted on the ice and suddenly
didn’t look like a bird at all. He
looked like just a little heap of
snow. He looked exactly like the
heap of snow that the young Otter
had seen over there several times
before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>You should have seen the eyes
of that young Otter pop out of his
head. He was so surprised that
for a full minute he couldn’t find
his tongue.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='t196'></a>Little Joe Otter’s eyes twinkled
more than ever. “Well, son,”
said he, “what did you see?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I saw your fish disappear,”
gasped the young Otter. “Now I
know where my fish went to. Do
you see that little white heap over
there that looks like snow?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Little Joe Otter laughed right
out. “Certainly I see it,” said he.
“I saw it as soon as we came over
here. I saw it and I knew what
it was. That is Whitey the Snowy
Owl, who has come down from the
Far North. He is very fond of
fish. I guessed right away who
had stolen your fish. Now we’ll
go over and see what he has to say
about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So together they swam over and
climbed out on the ice. Then they
made right straight for Whitey.
He turned his head, and the young
Otter saw as fierce a pair of eyes
as he had ever looked into. They
were round and yellow. Whitey
snapped and hissed. Then he
turned so as to face them. He
still clutched the fish in his claws.
Little Joe Otter snarled and
bounded towards him. Whitey
hesitated only a second, then spread
his broad wings and silently flew
away, taking the fish with him.
Little Joe was too big for him to
fight with.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So it was the Young Otter made
the acquaintance of Whitey the
Snowy Owl, and learned that there
is always an explanation for a
mystery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Enough is enough and I am sure
you have heard enough of Little
Joe Otter and his family. I could
tell you much more, but it wouldn’t
be fair to some other little people
in the Smiling Pool. And so the
next book in the Smiling Pool
series is to be about one whom you
all know and, if you are like me,
are fond of. It will be called Jerry
Muskrat at Home.</p>

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
